# READ PARAMS
#(you may include default values and make these optional parameters for your
# program):
# -Block size (number of words. Note that we donâ€™t differentiate in this project for
# words and bytes. You can assume all addresses are referring to words, and no
# further byte-word conversion is needed).
# -Number of lines/blocks in the cache.
# -Associativity (1 for direct, 2 for two-way set associative, etc.)
# -Hit time (in cycles)
# -Miss time (in cycles)
# -Replacement policy: Random and LRU



# Your program will be given a series of addresses (from an ASCII file that contains hex
# addresses with one address per line). One such file is provided to you, available in the
# assignment section of the blackboard system.
